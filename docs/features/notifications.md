# Notifications

!!! info "This feature was introduced in NetBox v4.1."

NetBox includes a system for generating user notifications, which can be marked as read or deleted by individual users. There are two built-in mechanisms for generating a notification:

* A user can subscribe to an object. When that object is modified, a notification is created to inform the user of the change.
* An [event rule](./event-rules.md) can be defined to automatically generate a notification for one or more users in response to specific system events.

Additionally, NetBox plugins can generate notifications for their own purposes.
