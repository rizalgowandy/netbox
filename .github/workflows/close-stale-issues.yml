            This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
            recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs. NetBox
            is governed by a small group of core maintainers which means not all opened
            issues may receive direct feedback. **Do not** attempt to circumvent this
            process by "bumping" the issue; doing so will result in its immediate closure
            and you may be barred from participating in any future discussions. Please see
            our [contributing guide](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).
